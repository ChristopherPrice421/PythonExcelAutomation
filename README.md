# PythonExcelAutomation
This is some examples of how updating excel files can be done in Python 

These give examples of reading and writing text files, connections to Databricks, importing data into excel, working with os to save/delete files, creating PDFs from Excel (done 2 ways), editing values within Excel and some basic data manipulation. The examples are of files I had to update while working at Next, therefore I can not share any data to show how this works.
